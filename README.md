2023 Engineers without Borders CEDR Hackathon 1st Place Winner ü•á! CyberGuardian - CyberGuardian's security &amp; ethical analysis for websites helps find alternatives with better privacy policies. Join us to make the digital world safer! üíª üîê


Inspiration

    The inspiration for our project came from the growing concern of online privacy and security.
    As more and more people rely on the internet for their daily activities, it's important to have a tool that can help them evaluate the safety and privacy of the websites they visit.

What it does

    Our project is a chrome extension called "CyberGuardian" that helps users evaluate the cybersecurity and ethical standards of websites
    The extension generates a security score and cyber ethics analysis for each website the user visits.
    It also provides alternative options for websites with better privacy policies.

How we built it

    We built the project using JavaScript and HTML, and used the OpenAI GPT-3 model to generate the analysis for each website.
    We also used a third-party API to gather data on each website's privacy policies and data collection practices.

Challenges we ran into

    One of the biggest challenges we faced was integrating the GPT-3 model into our project.
    We had to spend a lot of time fine-tuning the model and making sure the analysis it generated was accurate and relevant.
    We also had to work through some technical issues with the API we used to gather data on websites.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

    We're proud of the fact that we were able to build a tool that can help people evaluate the safety and privacy of websites.
    We're also proud of the fact that we were able to integrate the GPT-3 model into our project and generate accurate and relevant analyses for each website.

What we learned

    Through this project, we learned a lot about cybersecurity, online privacy, and the importance of ethical standards in the digital world.
    We also learned a lot about working with third-party APIs and integrating complex machine learning models into our project.

What's next for CyberGuardian

    In the future, we hope to expand CyberGuardian to include more features, such as a privacy score for each website and more in-depth analysis of data collection practices.
    We also plan to explore ways to make the tool more user-friendly and accessible to a wider audience.
